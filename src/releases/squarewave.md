title: Do I Really Give a Fuck, I'm Just a Square Wave
image: /media/squarewave.jpg
description: <p>Recently, Polyop’s visual artist Alex Kempton was clearing out
  his Dad’s attic, only to find an old oscilloscope which hadn’t been turned on
  since 1978. After dusting off and powering up the device, a square wave
  appeared on the screen. Appearing to be sentient, the square wave claimed that
  it had been trapped inside the machine, but also that it “didn’t really give a
  fuck”, because it’s “just a square wave”.<br><br>Alex powered the machine back
  down returning it to the attic where it belongs, but not before capturing the
  strange waveform on tape.<br><br>For the title track, Polyop transformed the
  recording and turned it into a punchy bubblegum-acid-breaks number. Hear the
  classic God Break combined with some wiggly Juno-60 filter-work to make your
  body pulse.</p>
