description: <p>Slug Chug is Polyop’s ‘firsty’ - a debut submission at a
  demoscene party - a meet-up where people compete and share their programming,
  music and visual works.<br><br>This 99BPM Acid Chugger accompanies a realtime
  WebGPU trip, with the ‘Nudibranch’ sea slug mascot going through procedural
  transformations deep in an alien ocean.<br><br>The demo was first shown in
  Berlin at <a href="https://www.demoparty.berlin/">Deadline</a> 2025, and was
  created with an alpha version of their audio-visual software, <a
  href="https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron">Hedron</a>, which is open
  source on GitHub.</p>
