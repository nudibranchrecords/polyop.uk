    <p>Polyop are an acid-rave audiovisual group from London, co-founded by Jack Driscoll and visual artist Alex Kempton, and later joined by Harry Orso, Finlay Macaulay and Larry Reeve. Since 2016 they’ve made their name performing their tripped out live show in the UK and across Europe.</p><p>The show takes the audience on a trip through the polyhedral universe, featuring a giant shape-shifting demi-God and a nomadic alien hive tribe, who harvest potent psychedelic crystals from a nearby asteroid belt.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Taking influence from early 3D graphics and 90’s rave culture, the music is performed live on hardware samplers and synths. The group experiments with new technologies, including Hedron, the open-source software designed for their shows, now used by artists around the world.</p><p>Polyop have traveled across Europe, as well as taking their show to clubs in London such as The Cause, Five Miles and Rich Mix. They have released on Nudibranch Records, Tru Thoughts and received DJ support and radio play from BBC 6 Music, Worldwide FM, NTS and Noods. This year, they released remixes to Damos Room’s Commencement // Mineral Blend EP, played on BBC 6 Music.</p>
