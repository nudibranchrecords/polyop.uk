    <p>Polyop are an acid-rave audiovisual group from London, co-founded by Jack Driscoll and visual artist Alex Kempton, and later joined by Harry Orso, Finlay Macaulay and Larry Reeve. Since 2016 theyâ€™ve made their name performing their tripped out live show in the UK and across Europe.</p><p>The show takes the audience on a trip through the polyhedral universe, featuring a giant shape-shifting demi-God and a nomadic alien hive tribe, who harvest potent psychedelic crystals from a nearby asteroid belt.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking influence from early 3D graphics and 90â€™s rave culture, the music is performed live on hardware samplers and synths. The group experiments with new technologies, including <a href="https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron">Hedron</a>, the open-source software designed for their shows, now used by artists around the world.</p><p>Polyop have traveled across Europe, as well as taking their show to clubs in London such as The Cause, Five Miles and Rich Mix. They have released on <a href="http://www.nudibranchrecords.uk">Nudibranch Records</a>, Tru Thoughts and received DJ support and radio play from BBC 6 Music, Worldwide FM, NTS and Noods. This year, they released remixes to Damos Roomâ€™s Commencement // Mineral Blend EP, played on BBC 6 Music.</p>
